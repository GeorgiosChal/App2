Controller is responsible to accept input
 in this case network requests to our different routes and 
 then the controllers needs to convert that
  
  into appropriate commands for our models and views so we 
  would say the controller is the middleman

depending on the incoming request, the controller 
will call the appropriate model and when thats done
then the controller will call the appropriate view and passIN 
any relevant data from the model
